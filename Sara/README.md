---------------------------------------
Create a new directory called 0x03-git in your Basics_takween repo.

Make sure you include a not empty README.md in your directory:

    at the root of your repository Basics_takween    AND in the directory 0x03-git

And important part: Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.

Repo:

    GitHub repository: Basics_takween

2. Coding fury road
mandatory

For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

    Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
    Create these empty files:
        c/c_is_fun.c
        js/main.js
        js/index.js
    Create a file bash/byaan with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "Byaan"
    Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
    Add all these new files to git
    Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server

Repo:

    GitHub repository: Basics_takween 
    Directory: 0x03-git
    File: bash/alx, bash/school, c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js
